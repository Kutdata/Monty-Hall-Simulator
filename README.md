Monty Hall Simulator 🎰🚪
Welcome to the Monty Hall Simulator! 🎉
This is a simple Python application that simulates the famous Monty Hall problem. It lets you explore how switching doors in the game show scenario can lead to a higher chance of winning. 🏆

📚 About the Monty Hall Problem
The Monty Hall problem is based on a game show scenario where you’re given the option to pick one of three doors. Behind one of the doors is a gold prize, and behind the other two are goats. After you make your first choice, the host (Monty Hall) opens one of the other doors to reveal a goat. Then, you're given the option to either stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining door.

Mathematically, it's been proven that switching gives you a 2/3 chance of winning, while sticking with your original choice gives you a 1/3 chance.

⚙️ How it Works
Simulation
This simulator runs multiple trials of the Monty Hall game and tracks the number of times you win by:

- Sticking with your original choice 🎯
- Switching to the remaining door 🔄

🏁 Features
- User Input: Enter the number of trials you'd like to run. 📊
- Real-time Results: View how many wins you have with your initial choice and after switching doors. 🏅
- Simple GUI: Built using Tkinter to keep things clean and user-friendly. 🖼️

🎯 Example Usage
1.Run the simulator.
2.Enter the number of trials (e.g., 1000).
3.Press Enter to see the results of your trials:
- Wins with Same Choice: How many times you won by sticking with your first choice.
- Wins by Switching: How many times you won by switching after Monty reveals a goat.

📈 Results
The simulator will show you the number of wins in both scenarios (staying vs. switching). You can experiment with different trial counts and observe how the probabilities align with the theory. 🧮

💡 Why It’s Fun
This simulator provides an interactive way to understand probability and how your decision-making can affect your odds. It’s a great tool for learning about probability and mathematical intuition. 🧠

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Tkinter (for GUI) 🖥️
- Random (for shuffling doors) 🎲
